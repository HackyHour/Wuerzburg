# About
Come to talk about science in a social environment.
If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science or you just want to drink a beer: join us.

# When and Where
Every fourth Thursday of the month at 5 pm at the [CCTB Würzburg](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Center+for+Computational+and+Theoretical+Biology+%28CCTB%29,+University+of+W%C3%BCrzburg/@49.7851224,9.9708763,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a28fc802e5e8d9:0x6b62d2cbd2e6f094).
You can come without registration but feel free to join the [Gitter-Chat](https://gitter.im/HackyHour/Wuerzburg) if you have any questions beforehand.
Usually we order pizza and sit together until roughly 8pm.

# Topics
In addition to the open discussions we also aim to talk about specific topics at each HackyHour.
