# About
Come to talk about science in a social environment.
If you want to know how computational tools and code can improve your science or you just want to drink a beer: join us.

# When and Where
Every fourth Thursday of the month at 5 pm at the [CCTB Würzburg](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Center+for+Computational+and+Theoretical+Biology+%28CCTB%29,+University+of+W%C3%BCrzburg/@49.7851224,9.9708763,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a28fc802e5e8d9:0x6b62d2cbd2e6f094).
You can come without registration but feel free to join the discussion in the linked pad (see table below) if you have any questions beforehand.
Usually we order pizza and sit together until roughly 8pm.

### Attention
Next HackyHour would be the 25th of May which is a holiday.
So please add your vote [here](https://github.com/HackyHour/Wuerzburg/issues/32) for an alternative date this month.
