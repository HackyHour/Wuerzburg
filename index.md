# About
Come to talk about Code, Tools and Science in a social environment.
If you have a problem in one of those areas you can bring it along and get help.
We also plan to make hands on sessions where we learn and apply new techniques or tools.
You can also look around for companions to join a professional or fun project.
# When and Where
Every last Wednesday of the month at 6 pm at the [CCTB WÃ¼rzburg](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Center+for+Computational+and+Theoretical+Biology+%28CCTB%29,+University+of+W%C3%BCrzburg/@49.7851224,9.9708763,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47a28fc802e5e8d9:0x6b62d2cbd2e6f094).
You can come without registration but feel free to join the [Gitter-Chat](https://gitter.im/HackyHour/Wuerzburg) if you have any questions beforehand.
Usually we order pizza and sit together until roughly 9pm.
