## Future Dates

A [representative poll](https://terminplaner4.dfn.de/u3fGuiEUz9RAj2fL) indicated, that Wednesday and Monday are tied in popularity. On each of these days, some people can not come. So we decided to switch to an alternating scheme:
- **odd** month: HackyHour is on the fourth **Monday** in the **physics department**
- **even** month: HackyHour is on the fourth **Wednesday** in the **CCTB**

### :exclamation: Re-evaluation time :exclamation:
It is time to re-evaluate this schedule. Here is a poll to vote for future start time and week day: https://terminplaner4.dfn.de/gEaqGnisuKOgga9b
Everyone who plans to come to the HackyHour (at least from time to time) in the future, is welcome to participate in the poll. Results of the poll are discussed in the July HackyHour.

### Orga
 - periodical date/time evaluation :calendar: :clock1: → discuss results of poll
     - Monday at 5 pm c.t.
 - HackyHour in August - summer break? → yes, next HackyHour in September on Monday in the CCTB
 - deRSE24: 05.03.24 - 08.03.24 in Würzburg, Naturwissenschaftlicher Hörsaalbau (Flo) Help wanted! → Werbung im CCTB
 - Sommerschule Physik (Anfang September)
 - meta: how to make HackyHours more efficient (some people have to leave when we are just starting with the topic of the day, because it took so long to order pizza and decide on a topic)
     - quicker decisions through less democracy (Markus enforces decisions)
     - define some defaults (e.g. one vegetarian option)
     - define rules (e.g. put required pizza emoji and wishes/exclusions)
     - fixed selection procedure for topics
     - topics will not be transferred by default
 - [some old conversations :pizza::dollar::no_entry_sign:](https://matrix.to/#/!oPWTDuKdRRcYTqzLUq:gitter.im/$2T9frtP4iyBeAwMmWSpZ86-Ulc5dPYKU63bcKtZ2w5A?via=gitter.im)
