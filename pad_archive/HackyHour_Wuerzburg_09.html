From the discussion I'd say we pick the following topic for Friday:<br
/>"Setup and configuration of a Nextcloud on a Raspberry Pi"<br
/>We will also briefly discuss our logo.<br
/><br
/>Topics for HackyHour?<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>I have some ideas:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><ul><li>Latex vs Word, intro to latex+1</li
><li>Literature management: Mendeley vs Endnote vs Zotero</li
><li>Image processing tools +1+1+1</li
><li>Julia +1+1</li
><li>Jupyter +1+1+1</li
><li>codingames: Mars Lander 2</li
><li><b>Logo design+1+1</b></li
><li>Virtualization (docker, virtualbox, VNC etc.)+1+1</li
><li>deep learning (Intro to Convnets, RNN etc. using python)+1+1</li></ul
>&nbsp;<br
/>I like the ideas suggested by Markus. My suggestions for future HackyHours are:<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>1.&nbsp; <b>Setting up OwnCloud on a Raspberry Pi/NAS (the entire process from&nbsp; preparing the Pi to setting up the account), and configuring it to work&nbsp; on an internet connection with Dynamic IP addresses.</b><br
/><b>&nbsp;+1 for that (we wanted to do this from the beginning)</b><br
/><b>then lets do this soon if it was planned anyway? sounds like it could be fun.</b><br
/><b>Why not have a look on the new kid on the block: Nextcloud</b><br
/><a href="https://www.canox.net/2016/06/die-eigene-cloud-mit-dem-raspberry-pi-und-nextcloud/"><b>https://www.canox.net/2016/06/die-eigene-cloud-mit-dem-raspberry-pi-und-nextcloud/</b></a><b> (german)</b><br
/><b>sounds interesting...I like the idea of accessing my NAS from outside without exposing all the notorious Synology exploits...</b><br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>2.&nbsp; App development on mobile platforms iOS/Android/Windows 10 Mobile (do&nbsp; we have anyone that has experience on this?). I know that this is a bit&nbsp; crazy :P<br
/>&nbsp;--&gt; I have a little (actually very little) experience with Android App Development<br
