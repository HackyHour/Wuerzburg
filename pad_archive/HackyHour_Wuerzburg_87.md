## Topic Suggestions
> Add your suggestions to the list (feel free to also add previously suggested topics, they are *no longer* automatically carried over). Topics are selected after a brief presentation through successive elimination. If someone comes with a real problem, this has priority.

 - Guess the [correlation](https://www.guessthecorrelation.com/), dice, hausdorff, p-values (e.g. 2-sample t-test (maybe different difficulties: bar chart, bar + SE, boxplot, jitter)), maybe reverse (draw something with a given dice/hausdorff/p-value) ... (maybe using [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/))
 - Generate synthetic data for linear model with two (binary) explanatory variables (A and B) and different real effects (only A has an impact, both A and B have an impact, the impact of A depends on B) - then look at the estimated coefficients (and their statistical significance) when fitting `~ A`, `~ B`, `~ A + B`, `~ A + B + A:B`
 - Programming Games ([list of suggestions](https://x-team.com/blog/coding-games/amp/))
 - [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs) - portable graphics library in rust, also running in the browser - maybe checkout [Learn wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/#what-is-wgpu)

### Maybe another time
 - Visualize [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) data with [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/)
 - deRSE24: https://derse24.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/
 - Network simulation with [Filius](https://www.lernsoftware-filius.de/Startseite)

### Past ideas

Topic suggestions are no longer carried over automatically, to speed-up the decision process. However, it might be interesting to revisit some past ideas at some point. Therefore, a collection of past ideas is maintained [on this smorgasbord](https://hackmd.io/@iimog/hhsb).

## Challenge Club

From time to time, we solve challenges together in the HackyHour.
It is usually undesired to share solutions publicly, as it spoils the fun for other players.
Therefore, we created a [private repository](https://github.com/HackyHour/Wuerzburg_ChallengeClub) where we collect our joint solutions. Just tell [Markus](https://github.com/iimog) if you want access.
