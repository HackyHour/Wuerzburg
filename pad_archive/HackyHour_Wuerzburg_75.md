# HackyHour Würzburg 75 :santa: :christmas_tree: :mother_christmas: :stars:

## Live
 - **When:** **Monday**, December 19<sup>th</sup>, 2022 at 5:00pm
 - **Where:** <!-- Physics Department - Seminar Room SE2 (https://hackyhour.github.io/Wuerzburg/pad_archive/HackyHour_Wuerzburg_76) 
 - **Info:** [HackyHour Website](http://hackyhour.github.io/Wuerzburg/)
 - :vertical_traffic_light:  If possible, we will be meeting live. Please only come if you are vaccinated, recovered or negatively tested (3G rules).

## Future Dates

A [representative poll](https://terminplaner4.dfn.de/u3fGuiEUz9RAj2fL) indicated, that Wednesday and Monday are tied in popularity. On each of these days, some people can not come. So we decided to switch to an alternating scheme:
- **odd** month: HackyHour is on the fourth **Monday** in the **physics department**
- **even** month: HackyHour is on the fourth **Wednesday** in the **CCTB**

We'll see how this works throughout the winter semester. Then we'll decide whether to keep it or change back to a fixed day of the week.

Because of the seasonal HackyHour :christmas_tree::santa::star: in December, we have another exception. It will be **Monday**, December 19 in the CCTB (even and odd got switched to make up for it and continue in the Physics department in January) :joy:
