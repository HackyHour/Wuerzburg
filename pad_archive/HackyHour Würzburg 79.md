## Future Dates

A [representative poll](https://terminplaner4.dfn.de/u3fGuiEUz9RAj2fL) indicated, that Wednesday and Monday are tied in popularity. On each of these days, some people can not come. So we decided to switch to an alternating scheme:
- **odd** month: HackyHour is on the fourth **Monday** in the **physics department**
- **even** month: HackyHour is on the fourth **Wednesday** in the **CCTB**

We'll see how this works throughout the next couple of months. Then we'll decide whether to keep it or change back to a fixed day of the week.
