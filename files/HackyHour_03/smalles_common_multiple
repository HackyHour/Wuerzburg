a = (10:10000) #Field (2520 first one)
b <- c() # initializes the list b (c is not a list but a function to create lists)
for(i in 1:length(a)) # will go through the list of a
{
  b[i] <- (a[i]%%5+a[i]%%7+a[i]%%8+a[i]%%9) # will make a simple division and compare if the quotient is a natural number
  }
d <- which(b==0)  #compares which elements of b equal 0 and returns the index number to d
a[d]    #Displays result in shell

rm(list = ls()) # Removes all variables from working memory
